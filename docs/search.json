    "text": "The folders inside this folder should contain all data at various stages.\nThis data is being loaded/manipulated/changed/saved with code from the code folders.\nYou should place the raw data in the raw_data folder and not edit it. Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata Ready for part 3 Clarke Miller"

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones."

I found the accuracy for this model is 0. I tried to fix the code with AI’s help but didn’t really work. So I guess maybe it’s because the model’s predictions are not accurate? And AUC is 0.5919 which might not be providing strong discrimination but might distinguish between the positive and negative classes is somewhat better than random chance based on my searching. For the rm2, HT is statistically significant predictors of SEX while others aren’t. Accuracy at 0.958 indicates the model is well-fitted, and AUC shows the excellent discrimination.\n\n\ntry k-nearest neighbors model\n\n# Split data into training and testing sets\nset.seed(123)  #

infant mortality reversely: low infant mortality will lead to high life expectancy and vice versa. But it cannot be applied to population. With the development of the countries, both population and life expectancy can increase which may show as a positive correlation.\n\n\nfigures out which years have missing data for infant mortality\n\nmissing_years &lt;- unique(africadata[is.na(africadata$infant_mortality), \"year\"])\nprint(missing_years)\n\n [1] 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969 1970 1971 1972 1973 1974\n[16] 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 1980 1981 2016\n\n\n\n\nnew object by extracting only the data for the year 2000\n\nafricadata_2000 &lt;- africadata %&gt;%\n  filter(year == \"2000\")\nprint(africadata_2000)\n\n                    country year infant_mortality life_expectancy fertility\n1                   Algeria 2000             33.9            73.3      2.51\n2                    Angola 2000            128.3            52.3      6.84\n3                     Benin 2000             89.3            57.2      5.98\n4                  Botswana 2000             52.4            47.6      3.41\n5              Burkina Faso 2000             96.2            52.6      6.59\n6                   Burundi 2000             93.4            46.7      7.06\n7                  Cameroon 2000             91.9            54.3      5.62\n8                Cape Verde 2000             29.1            68.4      3.70\n9  Central African Republic 2000            113.6            45.3      5.45\n10                     Chad 2000            105.7            51.5      7.35\n11                  Comoros 2000             72.7            62.1      5.32\n12         Congo, Dem.

The following space has the packages I decided to load just in case I’ll need them.\n\nlibrary(dslabs)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nThen, I used the str() function to explore the structure of the dataset and summary() to check the summary for each one of the variables of this dataset.\n\nstr(mice_weights)\n\n'data.frame':   780 obs. of  7 variables:\n $ body_weight : num  27.6 23 28.7 32.6 28.6 ...\n $ bone_density: num  0.616 0.769 0.684 0.644 0.53 ...\n $ percent_fat : num  7.26 4.95 6.02 9.54 6.99 ...\n $ sex         : Factor w/ 2 levels \"F\",\"M\": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ diet        : Factor w/ 2 levels \"chow\",\"hf\": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ gen         : Factor w/ 5 levels \"4\",\"7\",\"8\",\"9\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ litter      : Factor w/ 2 levels \"1\",\"2\": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n\nsummary(mice_weights)\n\n  body_weight     bone_density     percent_fat     sex       diet     gen     \n Min.   :18.13   Min.   :0.2708   Min.   : 2.552   F:398   chow:394   4 : 97  \n 1st Qu.:28.09   1st Qu.:0.4888   1st Qu.: 5.566   M:382   hf  :386   7 :195  \n Median :32.98   Median :0.5643   Median : 8.276                      8 :193  \n Mean   :34.08   Mean   :0.5697   Mean   : 8.594                      9 : 97  \n 3rd Qu.:39.37   3rd Qu.:0.6373   3rd Qu.:10.926                      11:198  \n Max.   :65.15   Max.   :0.9980   Max.   :22.154                              \n                 NA's   :4        NA's   :4                                   \n litter \n 1:442  \n 2:338  \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\nThis dataset consists of 780 observations of 7 variables: body weight, bone_density, percent_fat, sex, diet, gen (generation), litter. I am only interested in the bone density of both sexes of mice so I created a new object mice that includes “F” and “M” mice.\n\n#Used filter() to select only \"M\" and \"F\" from the variable `sex`. To do this I used the | operator which means \"OR\".\nmice &lt;- mice_weights %&gt;% filter(sex == \"F\" | sex == \"M\")\n\nTo explore if there was a difference between sex and bone density, I used ggplot() and geom_histogram() to create a histogram.\n\nggplot(mice, aes(x= bone_density, fill= sex))+\ngeom_histogram(bins = 30)+\nlabs(x= \"Bone Density\", y= \"Sex of Mice\")\n\nWarning: Removed 4 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the histogram above, it is observed that most of the male mice have a bone density of approximately 0.55 to 0.63, and for most of female mice are between 0.51 and 0.53, but there are a few high peaks. So, I decided to explore the relationship between bone density and generation. I created a plot that shows both sexes using both ggplot() and geom_point().\n\nggplot(mice, aes(x= gen, y= bone_density, color= sex))+\ngeom_point()+\nlabs(x= \"Generation\", y= \"Bone Density\")+\ntheme_linedraw() #Used this theme becuase I wanted to see what it would look like\n\nWarning: Removed 4 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the graph, it is observed that the bone density of both sexes remain constant from generation 7-9. However, around the 11th generation there must have been something to cause the increase in variation. The graph demonstrates that males typically have a higher bone density than females throughout the generations. Bone density increases for both male and female mice in the 11th generation. I wanted to explore if both sexes are correlate so I researched a simple correlation test, and decided to use the t.test() function in r. First I had to seperate the mice object to perform the test.\n\n#First I separated both sexes into separate objects using filter(). I  then used pull() to focus only on bone density.\nx &lt;- mice %&gt;% filter(sex == \"M\") %&gt;% pull(bone_density)\ny &lt;- mice %&gt;% filter(sex == \"F\") %&gt;% pull(bone_density)\n#Then I used summary()` to see if it ChatGPT was right and if it worked\nsummary(x)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n 0.3977  0.5553  0.6113  0.6233  0.6799  0.9980       3 \n\nsummary(y)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n 0.2708  0.4531  0.5090  0.5186  0.5793  0.8519       1 \n\n\nAnd now perform the Welch t-test using the t.test() function\n\nlibrary(\"ggpubr\")\nt.test(x, y, alternative = \"two.sided\", var.equal = FALSE)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  x and y\nt = 14.681, df = 768.68, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.09073555 0.11874660\nsample estimates:\nmean of x mean of y \n0.6233147 0.5185736 \n\n\nThe p-value of the test is &lt;2.2e-16, which is less than the significance level alpha = 0.05. We can conclude that Male mice’s average bone density is significantly different from Female mice’s average bone density."

One was that so many points and lines were overlapped and nothing can be seen clearly. The other was that since the geom_line function just connecting the points simply without any adjustment like broken line graph, but the line on the figure is slightly smooth curve. I asked for fixing the problems by replacint with geom_smooth function and found that the reason for the overlapping was that there were some surveys made in the same day. So I also averaged the percentages from the same day and used the new numbers for the scatterplot.\nBut to be honest, I still cannot figure out how I can make the plot wider so that it will look more

Document somewhere what inputs each script takes and where output is placed.\nIf scripts need to be run in a specific order, document this.

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at /Users/XylemHu/Desktop/EPID8060E/GitHub/xueyanhu-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(readxl)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata2.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."
